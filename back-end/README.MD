# Back End Challenge

Created a REST API that has both a get route and a post route for data creation and reading.

# Files
- **server.js** contains all the logic to implement routing and restful services
- **text.json** contains the sample I used when passing data through postman. 
This is also the file I used to write and read from.
- **README** Provides a brief description of work done

# Visuals

## Additional
I currently do not work with backend technologies but have had some interaction with the technologies 
I have used for this challenge, in the past.
While I have had my focus solely based on front end technologies these past few months, if given the
opportunity, I would love to continue to enhance my skills and become a full-stack developer.
