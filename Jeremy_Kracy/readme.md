## Frontend Challenge
I am not very experienced with webpage design. I do have a bit of experience working with html and css, but nothing extensive. I decided to use the bootstrap framework to design the layout on the webpage. I implemented the reCaptcha using the link referenced on the challenge instructions.

## Backend Challenge
I am not very experienced when it comes to working with APIs or designing them. I decided to use node.js with a mongoDB atlas cloud database to store my data. I used the mongoose extension to interact with my database.

## Database Challenge
I was most confident going into this challenge, because it is something I have done before. I am confident in my ability to make good decisions in regards to database design. I chose to use python for this assignment, because of how simple it is to work with .json files in python.
