# Frontend challenge

For the frontend of this application, I chose to use the Gatsby.js which is a framework that serves static page websites with the power of React. The beauty of Gatsby.js is that it allows for server-side rendering, so it is fast while still having the benefits of using components. 

## How to run
To run this program, all you have to do is enter into the `interviews/javascript/frontend/jamstack` folder and enter:

```
yarn install
gatsby build 
gatsby serve
```

Then all you need to do is navigate to [localhost:9000](localhost:9000) on any browser. Just make sure that you disable CORS so that the the Gatsby app can recieve the response from Google
