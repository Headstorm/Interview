### Built With

* []() Python
* []() HTML

### Using

* []() Flask, python microframework
* []() Flask's SQLAlchemy & Flask's Restful API


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have python 3.8.5 & flask installed along with the flask dependencies that are listed at the top of the app.py file. Specifically install flask_sqlalchemy & flask_restful along with flask.

### Installation

1. Clone my repo :) 
2. Install flask & flask requirements 
3. I set up a virtual environment & installed flask & the dependencies that way 

### Run The Project
4. Type "python app.py"

### Improvements
* I did not get a chance to add the requirements about the input being 500 numbers as json input. My current program takes in 5 numbers. It checks that there are exactly 5 integers, but does not check that there are 500 or the input. It only works if there are 5 numbers separated by commas. This addition to meet the 500 json requirements could be 
* met with more time.
