## Headstorm Interview
Hello! My name is Jeri "Betsy" Trammell. Please email me at betsytrammell0@gmail.com or call/text (318) 805-6761 if you have any questions or comments about the project. 


I used ReactJS, NodeJS, and ExpressJS for the frontend and backend challenges. For the database challenge purposes, I used mySQL (MERN stack).
### Download and Run
- cd into the client/ and server/ folders separately
- run ```npm install``` in both
- run ```npm start``` in both
- open localhost:3000 in your browser
>The output for the frontend and database challenges appears in the console. To view the output of the backend challenge, you will have to press the "Show JSON file." It will print the sorted file underneath the file upload buttons. 

### About the Files
- The new DB visualization is located in client/src/DBVisual
 - The files I was submitting for testing the Backend Challenge are located in client/src/BackendTestingFiles
