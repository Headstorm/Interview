# HeadStorm_Challenge
Repository that holds work for the HeadStorm Challenge 

## backEnd_challenge.py
This is the file that holds the code for the back end challenge. It is a standalone file with on dependencies on any other file.

## database_challenge.py
This is the file that holds the code for the database challenge. Using postgreSQL, python commands were used to create the database, the tables, and the INSERT commands to insert the data into the tables. Some dependencies include the testingFile.py, which randomly generated 25 entries that would be used to insert into the tables in the database and the oldData.txt, which held this information. The database_relationalModel.jpg shows the ER model of how this database is constructed. 

## frontEnd_Challenge.html
This is the file that holds the code for the front end challenge. One of the dependencies is the browserIcon.png file that is used for the icon on the browser, but aside from that this html file is a standalone file.
