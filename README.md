## Headstorm Interview

Welcome to the Headstorm interview challenge!  This repository is designed for candidates to [fork and create Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) with their solutions.  There are two types of 'take-home' problems here:

### Challenges
These are domain specific problems that can be submitted individually.  You can choose from backend, frontend, databases, or data-science.  You can submit a PR for one, many, or all the challenges.

### Interviews
These are language specific interview questions and you can choose the language in which you implement your solution.

Thank you for the opportunity.
