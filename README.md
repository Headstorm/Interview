# Zach's Interview
Hey there! For this implementation, I decided to use a Gatsby.js frontend and and Phoenix backend. In order to make the building process easy, I dockerized the build process so if you have Docker on your machine. 

## Instructions: 
1. Navigate to `interviews` directory 
2. Run docker compose:
```
docker-compose up --build
```
3. Navigate to necessary urls

### Frontend
```
localhost:9000
```

### Backend
```
localhost:4000
```
For API documentation, I created a Postman doc that you can view below:
