## Headstorm Interview

Welcome to the Headstorm interview challenge!  This repository is designed for candidates to [fork and create Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) with their solutions.  There are two types of 'take-home' problems here:

### Challenges
These are domain specific problems that can be submitted individually.  You can choose from backend, frontend, databases, or data-science.  You can submit a PR for one, many, or all the challenges.

*** SERVER RUNS ON PORT 3000 ***
Frontend Challenge  -> Contact page available at /contact.html 
Backend Challenge   -> requires a json input with key "numbers" and value being a list of integers 
Database Challenge  -> In order to start migration function hit endpoint /migrate with GET

### Interviews
These are language specific interview questions and you can choose the language in which you implement your solution.
