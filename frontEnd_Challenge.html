[INCOMPLETE]
Google reCaptcha V3 implement in page. Submission of form requires Google captcha pass

The implementation code for incorporating Google reCaptcha v3 was not difficult. The difficult part
that I was having trouble was using the keys and adding the local host as one of the sites. Apart from that,
the website will present a basic contact form where the user is expected to input their information.
That information will then be printed out on the Browser Console.
 -->

 <!--
     Assumptions that were made here is that the only information would be needed is the contact us form
     And that data would then be dumped into the console log. Other than that, made some changes to center it
     and to include the icon in the browser with a local file that is included with this file.
