# Frontend Challenge

I completed the front end challenge through HTML and CSS. I tried my best to implement the reCaptcha v3 verification. I started learning front end programming this semester, so looks-wise it is not pretty. 

# Backend Challenge

I tried the backend challenge, but I was not able to complete it. Any tips to complete it would be greatly appreciated.
