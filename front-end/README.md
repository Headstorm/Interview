# Front End Challenge
Created a contact form webpage using React.js, Material UI and Google reCAPTCHA.

## App Functionality
Here is a breakdown of how the app functions and what it contains:
- App has custom title and favicon
- Navbar with profile icon linking to personal linkedin. Navbar has different view when in mobile view.
- Implements google reCAPTCHA 
- Submit button is enabled after the following three conditions have been met:
  * Email field is completed
  * text field is completed
  * reCAPTCHA has successfully verified that you are a human
- Dumps contact information into the const on submit button click

# Additional
By no stretch of the imagination am I an engineer with years of experience. However, I have had the opportunity to work
with multiple front end technologies throughout my college career, which I have thoroughly enjoyed and want to continue to
work with, amongst many other technologies that I can learn and improve from. Thus, I hope my front end challenge can 
relatively make up for what I may have lacked in the backend challenge and in this way can be provided the opportunity 
to leverage my skillset in adding value to a team at Headstorm, while learning from the engineers there.
