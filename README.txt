The Front End Challenge and the Database Challenge are completed.
I was unable to complete a working program for the Backend Challenge but I have submitted all that I was able to get done.


During the Front End Challenge I was having trouble getting both of the reCaptcha and dumping the information onto the browser console to work.
However I was later able to figure it out and get all of the 5 tasks completed.

The Back End Challenge was the toughest one for me. I have not done any REST api work in the past so this was brand new to me. The main problem I had was getting it to run with an inputted json file.
Due to that I was unable to test ouit the POST and GET but I still wrote out what I beleived the program would look like. 

For the Database Challenge the main problem I had to figure out was how to work with JSON files. I was able to properly read in the file and output the SQL statements to the console for inserting the records into the new database.

Thank you so much for this opprotunity and I hope to hear back from you!
