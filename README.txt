This is my solution to the front-end-challenge

The project has been bootstrapped from create-next-app

I used react.js, html5, css3, sass to design and develop the webpage. 

the company's title and the company's logo(favicon) has been added to the browser tab, google recaptcha implemented successfully 
and the information from the for has been dumped to the browser console.
