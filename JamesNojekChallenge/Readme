Hello,

I've uploaded files for all 3 challenges, with Contact.cshtml representing the front end challenge, 
Backend.py for the back end challenge, and Database.py for the database challenge (not super creative I know).  I used additional 
files locally to test the programs, which I can upload if needed. I haven't worked in any part of web development or database manipulation, so I apologize for any 
redundancies or non traditional coding. It was very interesting having the experience to learn about these topics though, and I'm looking forward to any feedback I get.

Thanks,
James Nojek
