# Peter Tran's technical challenge submission

Hello! Thank you for giving me an opportunity to demonstrate my skills!  Please see the notes below that pertain to each challenge.

## Front End Challenge

**Techstack:** HTML, CSS, jQuery

I wanted to make sure the syntax was correct and the reCaptcha was working so I used the server for the back-end challenge to test the reCaptcha token.  Since it was not required for the challenge, I commented out the "verify" function that would have made a request to the server.

## Brack End Challenge

**Techstack:** Node.js, Express, MongoDB

To start the server, in the back-end-challenge directory, run the command in terminal: 

```
node server.js
```

The server will be served on: *localhost:8080*

## Database Challenge

**Techstack:** HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js, Express

To start the server, in the database-challenge directory, run the command in terminal: 

```
node server.js
```

Once the server has started, choose the file to be uploaded by accessing this [site](http://localhost:8080).
