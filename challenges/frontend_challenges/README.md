# Headstorm frontend challenges (Zhengran Jiang)
Here are my codes for the frontend challenges. Since it states to build a webiste quickly, I did not use any external JavaScript libraries like jQueries or React and keep my code minimal. 

Also, the frontend challenge states to use Google recaptcha v3 but the link directs to v2, so I assume that recaptcha v2 is the one that I should be using.
