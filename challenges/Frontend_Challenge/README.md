# Frontend Challenge for Headstorm

By Philip Kaufholz

# Introduction

Program that hosts a local website using Node.js Express with the functionality described in the challenge writeup.

The Umbrella Corporation has a short contact form implemented on their website, with Google reCaptcha v3 protection on form submits. reCaptcha v3 is invisible, only challenging when it suspects a user is a bot, and so the only noticable part is the "protected by reCaptcha".

The icon for The Umbrella Corporation is visible on the browser tab.

Information about the form submission is printed in the frontend and backend console on succesful submission, along with information about the reCaptcha calls.

# How to run

1. Install node packages ('npm install' in console)
2. 'npm start' in console
3. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/
4. Submit form!
