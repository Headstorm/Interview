# BACKEND CHALLENGE 
## Author: Neha Prabhune

### Goal
> Create a REST API using any language or web framework you prefer, which performs the following functionality:
* Provides a POST endpoint at /data where a user submits a JSON formatted list of 500 random numbers. The list has to be exactly 500 numbers, if there are more or less than 500 an error must be returned. Similarly, if something other than a list of numbers is submitted, an error must be returned.
* Provides a GET endpoint at /data which provides the same JSON formatted list of 500 numbers that are sorted from lowest to highest.

### Tools
* Python 3.x - Programming language
* JSON
* Flask
* requests
> NOTE: The data file is already given in the code.

I am relatively new to the concept of REST APIs, but I had some exposure and experience in the past with Flask. Hence, I decided to complete this challenge using Python. The calls are to be made to /data.
