REST API in Java / Spring Boot This project is a working solution to the Headstorm "Back End Challenge" The program will simulate the API call with a JSON formatted list, which proceeds to preform error checks then returns the sorted list back as JSON. For the purpose of this assigment, the JSON content is represented as a file of Strings and returned as a Strings in the output. The REST API is built using Java and Spring boot, which works its magic locally, but can be made as a remote call. A client was also created and provided to test the program. The client will generate the "JSON" as a long String of numbers, which gets fed into the API call as a parameter to then get parsed and processed on the back end.
