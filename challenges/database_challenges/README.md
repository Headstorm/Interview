# Headstorm database challenges Zhengran Jiang
Here are my codes for the database challenge. I use MySQL as the relational database language and python to display these commands.
There are test data generated by python and they are in the form of a list of dictionaries. The generate_test_data function generate a test file of size size. 
I did not print the create database and tables statement in console since it did not specifically say so. However, these create statements are in the database.py file starting at line 49. To print them, uncomment line 80.

The data visualization is in the form of an ER diagram in relational data model visualization.png
