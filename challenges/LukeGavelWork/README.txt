Hello, this is my work on the backend and database problem.

It was the first time I coded API related software and was struggling to find
a way to test it while flask was running. I believe it is set up correctly,
but I'm not familiar enough with flask to trigger the post or get commands

Next I have a layout of relational model version of the NOSQL model. Again,
not extremely familiar with databases so from looking at examples of relational database
I think I understand the gist: grouping data based on its relation with each other.
Apologies if I missed the mark on that. I did not have enough time to work on 
the second half of the challenge.
