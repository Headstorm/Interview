# Database Challenge 

I enjoyed this challenge, I have done something similar while learning about database normalization. I wish there was a set of more data that could of been used. I wanted to normalize the data up to at least until 3NF, and I believe that there might be more normalization that could be done especially with the work phone number.

# Setup 

This is just a Python script no virtual environment is needed but suggested. If you have Python installed locally, you should be able to run `python app.py` which will execute a display of queries.

Create a virtual environment:
  `python3 -m venv .venv`

Activate the virtual environment:
  `source .venv/bin/activate`
  
Run Script:
  `python app.py`
